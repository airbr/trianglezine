#### Triangle zine project

This is a personal project to finish a creative zine about a cherished if quite 'derro' (Dunedin slang for "derelict") neighborhood in Dunedin, New Zealand. 

I collaborated with a number of others on work towards this project who have contributed a variety of items in different mediums including:
 * 24 Photographs by Ted Whittaker 

... Full credits where due and production values to follow.

This project aims to incorporate some basic visual interaction/structuring of different kinds of content using good responsive web design and generally best practices in my code where possible.  This is also some of my first practices at making JS unit tests. I have not made tests prior to coding but plan to for additional units added.
