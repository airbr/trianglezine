#### Triangle zine project

This is a personal project to finish a creative zine about a cherished if quite 'derro' (Dunedin slang for "derelict") neighborhood in Dunedin, New Zealand.  
It aims to incorporate some basic visual interaction/structuring of content using good responsive web design. 

This is also some of my first practices at making JS unit tests. I have not made tests prior to coding but plan to for additional units added.

I collaborated with a number of others on work towards this project who have contributed a variety of items in different mediums including:
